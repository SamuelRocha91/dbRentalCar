This project was developed to manage the operations of a vehicle rental service. It utilizes an SQLite database called `dbRentalcar.db`, located in the `database` folder, which stores information about customers, cars, employees, and rentals. Additionally, migrations, seeds, and custom queries were created to manage and query data efficiently.

## Project Structure

- **database/dbRentalcar.db**: The main SQLite database file.
- **database/migrations/**: SQL scripts responsible for creating tables and their relationships.
- **database/seeds/**: Scripts to populate the database with initial data (customers, cars, employees, etc.).
- **query/**: Contains custom SQL queries to interact with the database.

## Main Tables

The tables created in this database include:

- **CUSTOMERS**: Stores customer information.
- **CARS**: Stores details of vehicles available for rental.
- **EMPLOYEES**: Contains employee information.
- **LOCATIONS**: Records rentals made, associating customers, vehicles, and employees.

## How to Use the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamuelRocha91/dbRentalCar
   ```

2. Install SQLite if you haven't already:
   - On Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install sqlite3
     ```

3. Access the database:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 database/dbRentalcar.db
   ```

4. Run the migrations to create the tables:
   - Navigate to the `database/migrations` folder and execute the SQL files.

5. Populate the database using the seeds:
   - Navigate to the `database/seeds` folder and execute the SQL files to insert initial data.

6. Use the custom queries in the `query` folder to interact with the database.

## Tools Used

- **SQLite**: Relational database management system.
- **SQL**: Query language for interacting with the database.
- **Migrations/Seeds**: Scripts for creating and populating tables in the database.
